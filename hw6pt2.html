    <h1>Ratios and Categories</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:green">The proportion of Georgia college graduates with science or engineering degrees. </h2>
    <p>My original data focused on the number of science/engineering graduates per county. To create the ratio for this assignment, I used the total number of college graduates per county. Dividing the two values provides the number of science/engineering majors in the overall number of graduates. This new cloropleth is a better representation of this data as it no longer simply highlights counties with higher populations. </p>
    
    <h2>Equal Count (Quartile) Classification</h2>
    <h3>This classification divides the data so there are equal groups in each of the five categories. This makes the shading of the map even, and it makes it easy for the viewer to see each category distinctly. However, one group may contain a wide range of data. For example, in this map, the fifth category has a county with 30.8% of graduates in the same category as a county with around 45% of graduates, which may be misleading. </h3>

    <h2>Natural Breaks Classification</h2>
    <h3>The natural breaks classification groups similar values together where there are gaps in the data. For this reason, values in a group do not tend to vary as far from one another, making the map more representative of the data and solving the issues seen in the equal value classification. In general, I found this method a good compromise between the other classifications.</h3>

    <h2>Pretty Breaks Classification</h2>
    <h3>Using the pretty breaks classification rounds the values of the data set. This makes the legend of the map easy to understand and "pretty" to look at. However, using pretty breaks for this set of data caused many of the counties to fall into the 20-30% category, which made it difficult to comprehend the map when it was created. The other classifications tended to break up the 20-30% range into different categories, which made the values more distinct and easier to comprehend. </h3>
